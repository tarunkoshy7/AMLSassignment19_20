# README

### Note: I deleted the main.py file provided as I felt the structure and presentation of the code would be a lot clearer if run directly from within the jupyter notebook for each task. Learning curves, validation curves, and classification scores are already saved in the notebook. If separate testing needs to be done, simply click on the kernel menu and click 'restart and run all'.

### Packages required: numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, cv2, dlib
